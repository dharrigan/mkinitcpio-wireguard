# Information pertaining to the WireGuard mkinitcpio hook
#
# Please ensure you've read the documentation on how to setup and configure
# WireGuard for your needs. It's vital that you ensure that you can connect
# successfully before working on enabling remote unlocking functionality.

#
# All the values below are just examples. You *MUST* change them to suit your
# particular WireGuard network setup.
#

#
# Specifies the name of the WireGuard interface (usually wg0).
#
INTERFACE=wg0

#
# Specifies the IP address that the WireGuard interface will use.
#
# Please ensure you specify the IP address in CIDR format.

# This is the public key of the peer (usually the WireGuard server).
#
PEER_PUBLIC_KEY=abcdefg

#
# This is normally the external public-facing IP address and port of the peer
# (usually the WireGuard server), but it may also be an internal IP address
# and port of a peer if you wish!
#
PEER_ENDPOINT=192.168.80.1:12912

#
# This is your private key previously setup to establish connection to the
# peer (usually the WireGuard server).
#
PRIVATE_KEYFILE=/etc/wireguard/initcpio/privatekey

#
# This is the preshared key to be used. Please uncomment it if you need to use
# a preshared key between peers. Don't forget to populate the preshared
# keyfile using something like:
#
# umask 077 && wg genpsk > /etc/wireguard/initcpio/presharedkey
#
# and that the preshared key matches configured on the other peer too!
#
#PRESHARED_KEYFILE=/etc/wireguard/initcpio/presharedkey

#
# If you're behind a NAT, a ping of 25 seconds is useful to keep the
# connection alive between the peers.
#

#
# The IP range that will be allowed to flow across the wg0 interface.
